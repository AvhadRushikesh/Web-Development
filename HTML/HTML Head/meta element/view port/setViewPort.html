        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Use <span style="color: brown;">meta</span> tag to set the <span style="color: brown;">Viewport</span></h1>
        <p>This method is introduced to take control over the <strong>viewport</strong> by using <strong>meta</strong> tag.
        <br><strong>viewport</strong> is the user's visible area of a webpage.
        <br>It changes from device to device and appers smaller on mobile phones than computer screens.</p>
        <h3>Syntax for meta viewport element:</h3>
        <p style="color: yellowgreen;">meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</p>
        <p>Here, the <strong>meta viewport</strong> element specifies how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
            <br>The <strong>width=device-width</strong> is used to set the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device
            <br>(Which will vary depending on the device).
            <br>The <strong>initial-scale=1.0</strong> is used to set initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
