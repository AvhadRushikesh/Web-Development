        <h3>Responsive Web design</h3>
        <p>Responsive web design is used to make your web page look appropriate, good, and well placedon all devices
            (desktop, tablet, smartphones etc.)
            <br>Responsive web design uses HTML and CSS to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content.
            <br>It makes the content look good or any screen.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: brown;">Responsive Images</h2>
        <p>Images which can be scaled nicely to fit any browser size are known as responsive images.</p>
        <h2 style="color: brown;">How to make Image Responsive?</h2>
        <p><strong>By using the width property</strong>
            <br>Set the CSS width property to 100% to make the image responsive and scale up and down.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>By using the max-width property</strong>
            <br>This method is best and most used because it facilitates that the image will scale down if it has to,
            but never scale up to be larger than its original size.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Change images according to the browser width</strong>
            <br>By using the <strong>HTML picture</strong> element, you can set two or more images according to the browser width.
            <br>It will change the picture when you change the browser-size. i.e. desktop and phone.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color: brown;">Responsive Text-size</h2>
        <p>We can make the text size responsive by using the <strong>"uv"</strong> unit.
            <br>It means viewport-width.By using this, we can make the text size to follow the browser window screen.
            <br><strong>Note:</strong> view port specifies the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width.
            <br>Means, if the viewport is 100cm wide, 1vw is 1.0cm.
