        <h1>HTML Computer Code</h1>
        <p>When we are programming, sometimes it is mandatory to show the Output result, error message, or coding part to user on a webpage.
            <br>Hence to solve this issue HTML uses different tags for the user inputs, codes, programs, etc.
            <br>With the help of these tags, you will be able to write codes to display on your webpage.
            <br><br><strong>Following is a list of some tags which are used in HTML for this task.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>code</li>
                <li>kbd</li>
                <li>samp</li>
                <li>var</li>
                <li>pre</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
