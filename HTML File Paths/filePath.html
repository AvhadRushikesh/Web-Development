        <h1>HTML File Paths</h1>
        <p>An HTML <strong>file path</strong> is used to describe the location of a file in a website folder.
        <br>File paths are like an address of file for a web browser.
        <br>We can link any external resource to add in our HTML file with the help of file paths such as images, file, CSS file, JS file, video, etc.
        <br>The src of href attribute requires an attribute to link any external source to HTML file.
        </p>
        <h2>Following are the different types to specify the paths:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>img src="picture.jpg"</strong></dt>
            <dd>-It specifies that picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page.</dd>
            <dt><strong>img src="images/picture.jpg"</strong></dt>
            <dd>-It specifies that picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder.</dd>
            <dt><strong>img src="/images/picture.jpg"</strong></dt>
            <dd>-It specifies that picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the current root of the current web.</dd>
            <dt><strong>img src="../picture.jpg"</strong></dt>
            <dd>-It specifies that picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder.</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        <h2>File paths are used on webpages to link external files like:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web pages</li>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>Style sheets</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>There are two types of file paths:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Absolute File Paths</li>
            <li>Relative File Paths</li>
        </ol>
