        <h1>Class Expressions</h1>
        <p>Another way to define a class is by using a class expression.
            <br>Here, it is not mandatory to assign the name of the class.
            <br>So, the class expression can be named or unnamed.
            <br>The class expression allows us to fetch the class name.
            <br>However, this will not be possible with class declaration.
        </p>
        <h2>Unnamed Class Expression</h2>
        <p>The class can be expressed without any name to it.</p>

            var emp = class{
                constructor(id, name){
                    this.id = id;
                    this.name = name;
                }
            };
            document.writeln(emp.name)
