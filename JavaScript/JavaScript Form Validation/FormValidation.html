        <h1>JavaScript Form Validation</h1>
        <p>It is important to validate the form submitted by the user because it can be have inappropriate values.
            <br>so, validation is must to authenticate user.
            <br>JavaScript provides facility to validate the form on the client-side so data processing will be faster than server-side validation.
            <br>Through JavaScript, we can validate name, password, email, date, mobile numbers and more fields.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript Form Validation Example</h3>
        <p>In this example, we are going to validate the name and password.
            <br>the name can't be empty and password can't be less than 6 characters long.
        </p>
        <p>Here, we are validating the form on form submit. The user will not be forwarded to the next page until given values are correct.</p>

        <form name="myform" method="post" action="abc.jsp" onsubmit="return validateform()">
            Name: <input type="text" name="name"> <br>
            Password: <input type="password" name="password"> <br>
            <input type="submit" value="register">
        </form>
        <script>
            function validateform(){
                var name = document.forms["myform"]["name"].value;
                var password = document.myform.password.value;

                if(name == null || name == ""){
                    alert("Name cannot be blank");
                    return false;
                }else if(password.length < 6){
                    alert("Password should be at least 6 characters long.");
                    return false;
                }
            }
